# Weather App

## Introduction
The **Weather App** is a Python-based application that provides real-time weather updates for any location. It fetches data from weather APIs and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions in an intuitive user interface. This app is useful for travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone needing quick weather updates.

## Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Fetch current weather conditions from an API.
- **Location-Based Search:** Get weather updates for any city or region.
- **Temperature Display:** View temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- **Humidity & Wind Speed:** Display additional weather parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple GUI using Tkinter or a web-based dashboard with Flask.
- **Data Visualization:** Display weather trends using Matplotlib (if needed).

## Technologies Used
- Python (>=3.7)
- OpenWeatherMap API (or any weather API for data fetching)
- Tkinter (For GUI applications, if applicable)
- Flask (For web-based applications, if applicable)
- Requests (For API calls)
- Pandas & Matplotlib (For data handling and visualization, if needed)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (>=3.7). You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up API Key:**
   - Sign up for an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
   - Add the API key to a `.env` file or directly into the script.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   If using Flask for a web-based system, start the server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Usage
- Open the application and enter a city name to fetch weather data.
- View temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit (if supported).
- Use the web version to access weather details from any device.
